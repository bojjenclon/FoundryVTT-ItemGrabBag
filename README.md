# Item Grab Bag

This module provides a simple means of sharing items across users. This is accomplished via a dialog accessible from the Items sidebar, just above the footer. Clicking the "Open Grab Bag" button will show a popup that items can be dragged to. From there, any item can be viewed by clicking on its name, taken by a player, or removed by the GM. Items are kept in sync across clients via socket actions.
